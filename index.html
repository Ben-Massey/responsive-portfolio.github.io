      <p>Hello, My name is Ben Massey. I have been working at Amazon for three years now as a Problem Solve P.A. In this position
        I am tasked to oversee the Problem solvers. The problem solvers are a group of Associates that are held accountable
        to make sure all customer orders make it out of the building on time and in great condition. I run inventory
        checks and relay system bugs to ensure that customers are getting exactly what they ordered.</p>

      <p> I am currently working on a Computer Science degree at UNT. I am also in a coding bootcamp to become employer competitive
        for a job in web development. My goal is to have a job in web development by March of 2019.</p>
